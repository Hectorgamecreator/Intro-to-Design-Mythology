        <h2>  河童 (Kappa)</h2>

    <h2>Background history</h2>
        <h3>English translation: River Child</h2>

        <p>Kappa are revered in Shinto as a kind of water god. It is not uncommon to see offerings of cucumbers made at riverbanks by devout humans; in return, kappa are known to help people by irrigating fields, befriending lonely children, competing with adults in sports and games, and so on. </p>

 <p>Also “records” of violent moments, where they will attack cows and horses for no reason, and will hurt women. </h4>
    <p>But once you can gain respect and friendship from a Kappa, they will be loyal to you forever, granting any tasks you wish for them to do.

    <h2> Two Main stories/folktales about Kappas</h2>

    <h3> Kappa To Shirikodama</h3>
    <h3> The Kappa of Miwako-Cho</h3>
    <h3>The One Armed Kappa</h3>
    <p>Might be the inspiration for the 2007 animation film, Kappa no Coo to no natsuyasumi.</p>
 
<p>In current media, Kappas are used as motifs of mockery and childlikeness.
