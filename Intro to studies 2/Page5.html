    <h2>Haetae in Korea can be said to be different from the Haetae transmitted in China.

    <p>Haitai was an animal that only the emperor could use, and it had no horns.
    </p>

<p>It was portrayed to almost like a lion.
</p>

<p>However, in Seoul, it was built with only the horns removed from the Chinese statue of Haitai.

    <li style="padding-bottom: 2em" >The folk tales handed down in Korean tradition have become to be recognized as a spiritual creature that prevents fire.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 2em" >In the Donggukse period, which was compiled during the reign of King Jeongjo, On New Year’s Day, a dragon or tiger is drawn on the gate, haitai is in the kitchen, a dog is in Gwangmun, and a chicken is placed between Anchae and Sarangchae.</li>


</section>
<p>Haitai is known as a symbol of law, but differently in Korea, it is well known for its image of a familiar spirit creature that suppresses fire.
</p>
<p>Therefore, it became the motif of the current fire masco.</p>

<h3>Sculptures of the legendary creature Haetae can be spotted around Seoul, often near historical landmarks and other high-profile locations like the National Assembly Building.</h3>

<div class ="image1H"></div>

<p>Shaped like a lion with a horn on its forehead, the imaginary animal from Korean mythology is known as a guardian that fends off fire and disasters, prompting creative architects to erect a number of sculptures around the city.</p>

<p>Haetae’s influence and likability have been reflected across South Korean society, with a professional baseball team and a major food company named after the imaginary animal, and the creature honored as the symbolic icon of the South Korean capital in 2008.</p>
