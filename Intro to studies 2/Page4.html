<h3>What were this god's characteristics? </h3>

<p>Quetzalcóatl was often represented as a man with a beard, and, as Ehécatl, the wind god, he was shown with a mask with two protruding tubes (through which the wind blew) and a conical hat typical of the <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/topic/Huastec">Huastec</a> people of east-central Mexico. The temple of Quetzalcóatl at <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Tenochtitlan">Tenochtitlán</a>, the Aztec capital, was a round building, a shape that fitted the god’s personality as <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Ehecatl/">Ehécatl.</a></p>
<p>Quetzalcóatl ruled over the days that bore the name ehécatl(“wind”) and over the 18th 13-day series of the ritual calendar. He was also the ninth of the 13 gods of the daytime hours. Although he was generally listed as one of the first-rank deities, no ceremonial month was dedicated to his cult.</p>

<p>Quetzalcóatl was particularly venerated in the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/calmecac">calmecac</a>, religious colleges annexed to the temples, in which the future priests and the sons of the nobility were educated. Outside of Tenochtitlán, the main centre of Quetzalcóatl’s cult was Cholula, on the plateau region called Mesa Central.</p>

<h3>How has society used this god’s image?</h3>

<p>As a gamer, I was astonished to see Quetzalcóatl in a game called <a href>“Smite.”</a></p>
<p>Smite is a MOBA, Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, similar to League of Legends or Dota.</p>
<p>Smite’s characters are gods from various cultures. Smite used a different name for Quetzalcóatl, instead they used “Kukulkan.”</p>
<p>Smite has five classes known as Mage, Assassin, Guardian, Warrior, and Hunter.</p>
<p> Kukulkan is a mage, his abilities does represent his traits as the Aztecs portrayed him which is fascinating.</p>


<section id ="info">
<h3>Is Smite being cultural appropriate with using gods?</h3>
<p>I don’t believe the use of Quetzalcoatl in Smite was to mock mesoamerican cultures, instead the game creators invented a perspective of Quetzcoatl known as “Kukulkan” and they added the lore of the diety. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/07/03/should-we-keep-religion-out-of-games">IGN</a> reported Rajan Zed the leader of the head organization called the “Universal Society of Hinduism” based in Nevada.</p>

  <p>He call himself as the “Hindu leader”, he has slammed Smite for the improper portrayal of the Hindu gods used in the game.</p>

  <p>IGN intreviewed Hi-Rez’s co-founder and COO Todd Harris about Zed’s opinion. Harris argued Hinduism is “embracing and tolerant” and that Hindu’s ancient stories have often been used for entertainment purposes. Harris adds to the argument, mythology associated with those religions do not include deities battling with one another and not appopriate to tell a story from that point-of-view.</p>
