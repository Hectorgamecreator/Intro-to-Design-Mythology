        <h2>Background history</h2>
    <p>Ganesha is an elephant-headed Hindu god of beginnings, who is traditionally worshipped before any major enterprise.</p>
    
    <p>His name means “Lord of the People.”</p>

    <p>Lord Ganesha clears the obstacles and paves the way for us to move forward in life. The large elephant head of Lord Ganesha symbolizes wisdom, understanding, and a discriminating intellect that one must possess to attain perfection in life.
    </p>

    <p>His vehicle is the large Indian bandicoot rat, which symbolises Ganesha’s ability to overcome anything to get what he wants. Like a rat and like an elephant, Ganesha is a remover of obstacles.</p>
 
    <p>He has four hands – one with an axe to cut off attachments, one with a rope to pull a person towards the highest goal, one with a sweet to reward those who live a life of spiritual discipline, and one held with the palm out to give blessings and protect those on the path of spirituality.</p>

    <h3>Many see the union of Ganesha’s body and elephant head as a representation of how the spirit should live in harmony with nature.</h3>
    <h3>His large elephant head is also an embodiment of wisdom and understanding.</h3>
    <h3>His round belly can be seen as the cosmos, while the snake around his waist is the energy that holds the cosmos together.</h3>
    <h3>The mouse he rides is like the wandering mind that can be controlled under the weight of knowledge.
    </h3>

    <h3>Lord Ganesha has become a commodity, with sculptures, keychains, clothing, pendants, movies, video games, books, calendars, stickers, bags, toys, and much more are now available.</h3>
