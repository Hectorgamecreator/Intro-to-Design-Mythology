        <h2 ><strong> "Mythology & Folktales"</strong></h2> 
    
<hr>

       <h3> We will first examine fables, folktales, and mythological tales that we find interest in to research about.</h3>
    
<h3> Each member is responsible for studying from distincts cultures and it is up to them to add onto their research (i.e. a voice record, artwork, data table, etc.). </h3>

<h3>This will lead to our second part of the research which is to see how media and culture has perceived and taken these tales to their hands.</h3>
    

<h3>Was it a healthy portrail? Was it a violent rip of cultural appropriation? This will connect to the idea of how cultures and spirituality have become a commodity, an accessory, especially in the western world. </h3>
  
<h3>This will be a website based project with a dissertation-like product as the navigator will be able to click onto which cultureâ€™s folktales they will like to read about.</h3>

<h3>  Each member has the freedom to make this as fun or as serious as they wish, but will have to fulfill it back to commodity fetishization.</h3>
